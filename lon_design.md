My first thought would be a depleting bar, similar to fragile unity but improved

drawing inspo from hoi4 italy mechanics as well here but to depict LoN legitimacy as an org, you can check for “unlawful activities” such as declaring war on a fellow member state, using mobilization options like chem warfare in battle (keeping them on but not going to war is technically not a violation i guess?), and so on

Every country you want gets this JE, and its a global variable to measure the bar. Say it starts at 100, and deplete by 20 every time member states go to war (with vicky AI its likely to die very quickly, so you may want to scale it to the rank between main participants), deplete by 1 weekly for every ongoing battle that has chem warfare enabled, and deplete by 30 if a GP leaves (lesser nations will be scaled by rank)

Having general peace will be a passive +1, enforcing peace (via button in the JE/decision, enabled only for core members) is a +20

Other buttons can be Leave LoN
Petition for aid
Petition for expansion of members

US will start with a related JE on whether to join LoN or not
